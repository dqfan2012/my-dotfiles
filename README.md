# Dotfiles

My dotfiles. They're managed using dotbot.

# Inspiration

Inspired by [Dotfiles by cvuorinen](https://github.com/cvuorinen/dotfiles)

I've always used terminator as my terminal of choice. My terminal theme ([powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k)) and terminal colors are directly inspired by the dotfiles by cvuorinen. I use [Nerd Fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts).

# Install

 - Clone this repo
 - Run ./install

 The installation script will automatically execute the script that's in the post-install directory. All dependencies required to use my dotfiles will automatically be installed by the post-install script. Once the post-install script has finished running your system should automatically reboot. Enjoy!

 # Configuration

 See [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot/) docs for more info and [install.conf.yaml](https://github.com/dqfan2012/dotfiles/blob/master/install.conf.yaml) for examples.
